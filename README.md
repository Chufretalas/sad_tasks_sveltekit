# Sad Tasks - Sveltekit

Just a simple notes/tasks webapp made with sveltekit and pockebase.  
I have to say, svelte is looking great so far, coming from react this feels a lot nicer to develop, so I intend on doing more with it in the near future. The same goes for pocketbase, because of just how easy it is to setup adn use.
